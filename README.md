##  Production Deployment (Render)

These steps prepare and deploy the Django app to Render's Python Web Service.

### 1. Environment Variables
Required (set in Render dashboard or blueprint):
```
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=codeversehub.settings_production
SECRET_KEY=<generate a strong random key>
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=codeversehub.onrender.com
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True
# Provided automatically if you add a Render PostgreSQL: DATABASE_URL
```

Optional email / extras see `.env.example`.

### 2. Build & Start (Already in render.yaml)
```
Build:  pip install -r requirements.txt
   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   python manage.py migrate --noinput
Start:  gunicorn codeversehub.wsgi:application --log-file -
```

### 3. Static Files
WhiteNoise serves collected assets from `staticfiles/`. Run `collectstatic` each deploy (handled in buildCommand). Do not commit `staticfiles/`.

### 4. Database
Local dev uses SQLite. In production attach a PostgreSQL instance (Render add-on) which injects `DATABASE_URL`. The `settings_production.py` will parse it with SSL and persistent connections.

### 5. Migrations / Admin
After first deploy run (if not automated):
```
python manage.py createsuperuser --settings=codeversehub.settings_production
```
You can run this via a one-off shell in Render.

### 6. Security Checklist
- DEBUG = False
- SECRET_KEY set & secret
- ALLOWED_HOSTS includes your Render domain + custom domains
- HTTPS enforced (Render provides TLS; `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` is set)
- `collectstatic` completes without missing files

### 7. Health & Logs
Use Render logs to monitor startup. Gunicorn logs go to stdout.

### 8. Scaling
Start with single instance (free plan). For higher traffic: raise plan, add worker processes (e.g. `gunicorn --workers 3`). For WebSockets or async tasks consider moving to ASGI + Daphne/Uvicorn.

### 9. Background Tasks
If you later add async tasks (Celery/RQ) deploy a separate worker service. Not required for current feature set.

### 10. Media Files
Currently stored on disk (`/media`). Render disk is ephemeral; for persistence use an external storage (e.g. AWS S3, Backblaze). Adjust `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` accordingly when you add that.

### 11. Netlify Note
Netlify cannot natively host this dynamic Django backend. If you build a separate SPA later you can deploy it to Netlify and point API calls to the Render backend domain.

### Quick Local Production Simulation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=codeversehub.settings_production
export SECRET_KEY=test-local
export ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python manage.py migrate --noinput
gunicorn codeversehub.wsgi:application
```
